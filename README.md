# Sample-Handling
A small sample of the many vehicle handlings I've created. No other handling changing scripts were used.

Sample includes both a RWD and an AWD handling file to best express balance regardless of drive train differences. To test the handling files, either copy the contents inside the handling files or replace the already existing handling files with the ones provided. Keep in mind that some values in the handling file like the inertia will not change unless the server is restarted. Vehicles were tuned with regard to balance, smoothness and uniqueness.
